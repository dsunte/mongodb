# Sample Data

## Installing sample data:
* Make sure you have a `mongod` instance running!
* Use the `mongo` shell to run one of the `*.js` scripts in this directory
* Example: you want to populate the `customer` collection in the `sweetscomplete` database:
```
mongo /path/to/files/sample_data/sweetscomplete_customers_insert.js
```
